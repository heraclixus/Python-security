    "The property of a SET-UID program is that when it is executed by a normal user, its _effective UID_ is root, but real UID is not root. The following program is SET-UID program and wants to write to /tmp, which is globally writable. The SET-UID program has root privilege to write to any files, but to enforce that only the real user can write to the file, the program checks if the real UID is correct. This is done through `access()` call. The program thus checks if the real user has the privilege to write to the file `/tmp/x`. \n",

    "`open()` system call checks the effective UID of the program, whereas `access()` checks the real user ID for the program. The code on the system call `open()` from execution. However, there is a window between the time when file is checked and time when file is opened. <br>\n",
    "To make use of the vulnerability in this 'blink of time', we can think of using __symbolic link__. Suppose that we want to modify the file `/etc/passwd`, but we can only write to `/tmp/x`. Now: \n",
    "* Before running the privileged program, we create a regular file X inside the `/tmp` directory. \n",
    "* This will pass `access()` check since it is our own file. \n",
    "* Right after `access()` can before program reaches `open()`, we quickly change `/tmp/x` to a symbolic link to the `/etc/passwd`. \n",
    "* When `open()` is invoked, it will open the passwd file, and since it only checks euid, now the program has write access to the file.\n",
    "Since the modern processor runs instructions in less than miliseconds, it is very unlikely to successfully execute the linking in between. However, with large number of tries, it is possible to do the work right in the interval. "
