    "__spoofing__ refers to send out packets under a false identity. <br>\n",

    "### Network Packet Transmission on physical layer\n",
    "Machines are connected to network via Network Interface Card (__NIC__). As data flow in the medium, every NIC on the network will hear all the frames on the wire. When a frame arrives via the medium, it is copied into the memory inside the NIC, which checks the destination MAC address to see if it matches the NIC's MAC address. If it matches, the frame is further copied into a buffer in the kernel, through Direct Memory Access (DMA). The card then interrupts the CPU to inform it about the availability of a new packet, and the CPU copies all the packets from the bnuffer into a queue, making room in hte buffer for more incoming packets. Callback handler functions are used by OS to dispatch the packets to user-space programs. \n",
    "#### Promiscuous Mode \n",
    "In general, frames not destined for the destination NIC are discarded rather than being passed to CPU for processing. However, for most NIC, _promiscuous mode_ allows NIC to not drop and passes every incoming frame to the kernel. If a sniffer program is running, all these frames can be dispatched to the sniffer program for further processing. \n",
    "#### Monitor Mode\n",
    "Monitor mode for wireless network cards supports sniffing too. When in monitor mode, the cards capture 802.11 frames transmitting on the channel that they are listening to. This means that unlike ethernet, in wireless cards, it is possible to miss information on the same network due to different channels. Most wireless NIC has their monitor mode disabled by the manufacturers. "
