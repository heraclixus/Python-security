    "__COW(Copy on Write)__ is the behavior described above. It is an optimization technique that allows virtual pages of memory in different processes to map to the same physical techniques that allow vritual page of memory in different processes to map to the same physical memory pages if they have identical content. <br>\n",

    "* The OS let the child process share the parent process's memory by making their page entries point to the same physical memory. \n",
    "* The page entries for both processes are normally set to read-only to prevent writing to memory. \n",
    "* When one process tries to write to the memory, exception will be raised, and OS will begin to allocate new physical memory for child process (Copy the contents from parent process, and change child's page table, so that each process's page table points to its own private copy of memory) \n"

    "#### Discard the Copied Memory \n",
    "After a program gets its private copy of the mapped memory, it can use a system call `madvise()` to further advise the kernel regarding the memory. The system call is defined as:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int madvise(void *addr, size_t length, int advice); \n",
    "```\n",
