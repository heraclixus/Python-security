    "This type of exploit happens on a malicious web page: when viewed by the victim, it sends a forged request to a targeted website on behalf of the victim. Since the request normally comes from a third-party web page, it is called cross-site request. <br>\n",
    "When a page from a website sends an HTTP request back to the website, it is called __same-site request__. If the request is sent to a different website, it is called __cross site request__. <br>\n",
    "If a website embeds an image from another website, then HTTP request used to fetch the image is a cross-site request. Online advertisers use cross-site requests to help display relevant advertisements to users, such that when the user visits the advertisements, they send HTTP request to the advertisement servers. \n",

    "The server does not know whether the HTTP request is same-site or cross-site, this is because the browser sends all the cookies belonging to the server's domain name every time it sends HTTP request. <br>\n",
    "This introduces vulnerabilities, because whereas requests from the web's same pages are trusted, those coming from other sites cannot be trusted. Therefore, it is important for a website to know whether a request is cross-site or same-site. __Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)__ is the scenario where a third-party website forges requests that are exactly the same as those in same-site requests.
